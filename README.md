## Data Structure

### Flashcard Set
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  title: string;
  createdAt: number;
}
```

### Flashcard
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  setId: string;
  front: string;
  back: string;
  tags: string[];
  learned: boolean;
  createdAt: number;
}
```

## Storage

All data persists in browser localStorage via Zustand middleware. Data survives page refreshes and browser restarts.

## Import/Export

Export creates JSON file with all sets and cards. Import accepts same JSON format for backup/restore or data transfer between browsers.
